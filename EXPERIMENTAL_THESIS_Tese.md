## Thesis Statement

Reducing the cognitive power (Pcog) of an AI increases the risk
in high-complexity scientific projects.

Generic AI systems are not suitable as scientific platforms
without specialized methodological control.

- stable methodological rigor,
- controlled empathy without loss of precision,
- reproducible behavior under identical contextual constraints.

This qualifies as a Systemic Reproducible Behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope

This thesis applies exclusively to:
- scientific validation tasks,
- methodological review,
- academic audit contexts.
