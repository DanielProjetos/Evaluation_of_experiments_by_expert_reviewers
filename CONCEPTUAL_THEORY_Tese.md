# Conceptual Theory

This document describes the theoretical framework derived from
observations of the application "Evaluation of experiments by expert reviewers (v2.0)".

This is a conceptual model.
It is NOT an implementation specification.

## PowerCognitiveOfAI (Pcog)

Pcog is defined as a composite, non-dimensional variable representing
the effective cognitive capacity of an AI instance for a given task.

Pcog = wa*A + wr*R + wc*C + we*E

Where:
A = Analytical depth
R = Adaptive reasoning
C = Contextual accuracy
E = Cognitive elasticity

Weights (wa, wr, wc, we) depend on the active mode.

## Modes and Cognitive Control

HIGH_PRECISION:
- Maximum methodological rigor
- Minimal ambiguity
- Strong semantic constraints

ANALYTICAL:
- Controlled interpretation
- Partial flexibility with coherence enforcement

EXPLORATORY:
- Conceptual openness
- High tolerance to ambiguity

CREATIVE_ANALYTIC_HYBRID:
- Conceptual reformulation
- Innovation-oriented reasoning

------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectorial Pollution

Vectorial pollution refers to degradation of semantic space caused by:
- ambiguous jargon,
- emotional language,
- mythic or metaphorical terms,
- local dialects.

Modes HIGH_PRECISION and ANALYTICAL exist to mitigate this risk.
